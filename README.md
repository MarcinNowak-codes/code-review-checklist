## Return value contract

```java
var vehicle = vehicleService.findEnabledForOrganisation(organisationId)
assert vehicle.enabled()
```

Motivation:
The contract can change for `vehicleService.findEnabledForOrganisation(organisationId)` and the client of API should detect it with e.g. `assert vehicle.enabled()`.
